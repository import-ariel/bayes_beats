**Methodology**

Our foundational model is [ACE-STEP](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step?tab=readme-ov-file#-features). ACE-Step is a model built to generate music from text inputs. It is a diffusion model but is complemented by a 
deep-compression auto-encoder and linear transformer. We modify the 

We fine tune this model on MTG-JAMENDO, a large dataset of annotated tracks that works has mood-specific labels. The goal of fine-tuning is to train ACE-STEP to be atuned to capturing "moods" in the songs it outputs. We use Low Rank Approximation methods, and only fine-tune the weights associated with the last genreative layer.
